                    <span>Added: experimental support for iTunes podcast feed: Demo | Source. With this new release, you can render an audio control to play the mp3 file and display iTunes episode duration. It is &quot;experimental&quot; due to these caveats:

This feature is currently only available through custom template.
iTunes has no strict format requirement for duration. The unit is most likely seconds but can be &quot;hh:mm:ss&quot; or &quot;mm:ss&quot; for some sources. A future version may expose a human readable string to the template.
No image support yet. Some shows might have disabled CORS or use a relative URL for image, which forces osmosfeed to download the image during build. A future version may support it.
You can&#x27;t republish the podcast in the feed output. Supporting this goes beyond the scope of the project at the moment.
Fixed: the articles in template data were not sorted.

                    <span>Changed: Smart summary truncation. When there is no dedicated summary (only Atom feed has it, and many sites don&#x27;t use it) from the source, we check if the content/description (Both Atom and RSS) field is long enough to be full text. If so, it will be truncated into a &quot;pseudo&quot; summary. If not, we assume the source used the content field as summary, and it will be displayed in full length.
Thank you: @LooperXX.</span>

本周话题：游戏开发者的年薪
最近，推特上面有很多欧美的游戏开发者，晒自己的薪水，使用 #GameDevPaidMe 这个标签就能看到，从中可以了解国外程序员的收入。
下面是一个美国开发者的发言。

他有超过十年的开发经验，年薪是20多万美元。这还是在西雅图，如果在湾区，工资可能还会再高一些。这跟我听说的差不多，美国高级程序员的年薪，一般都会超过20万美元（约130万人民币）。
我没想到的是，欧洲程序员的年薪，比美国少非常多。

上面这个英国开发者，作为高级程序员，年薪居然才4万英镑（约36万人民币）。他入行时，更是少到1.5万英镑（约14万人民币）。欧洲其他国家的情况也差不多，年薪也就几万欧元，如果是东欧国家（比如波兰），薪水就更低了。
这就是令我吃惊的地方， 西欧国家的人均 GDP 远高…</span>

                    <span>重庆市前市长黄奇帆退休以后，受聘担任复旦大学特聘教授，定期给师生做讲座，介绍他对中国经济的看法。

他的12次讲座，去年汇集成书出版了，书名叫做《分析与思考：黄奇帆的复旦经济课》。

我最近读了以后，发现他在讲座中经常引用各种数字，而且会解释了背后的经济逻辑。怎么理解各种经济指标，怎么用它们指导经济政策，讲得深入浅出，我觉得很有价值。
下面就是我从书中摘录的一些片段，相信可以帮大家更好地看懂中国经济。
一、金融业产值
中国经济的一个严重问题是，金融企业的产值过高。金融业增加值占 GDP 的比重是百分之八点几，全世界最高。世界金融业产值占全球 GDP 是5%左右。这个比重过高，意味着金融业吃掉了其它产业的利润。
但是，如果仅仅统计中国的银行、证券、保险的金融增加值，其实也就是4%--5%。多出来的3%是非银行的金融企业形成的，包括信托、小贷、保理、担保公司、财务公司、互联网金融公司、私募基金等。
现在银行的贷款利率一般在7%，到了信托公司，贷款成本一般都在12%以上，到了小贷公司就会上升到18%--20%。层层上升的资金成本，导致实体经济融资难、融资贵，利润就这样转移到了金融业。
目前，中国企业的总负债是 GD…</span>

本周话题：内容渠道的贬值
上周，美国的 Verizon 公司宣布，将以前收购的两个网站---- AOL 和 Yahoo ----一起打包卖掉，一共50亿美元。
