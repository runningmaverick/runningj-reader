With this new release, you can render an audio control to play the mp3 file and display iTunes episode duration.

The unit is most likely seconds but can be \"hh:mm:ss\" or \"mm:ss\" for some sources. A future version may expose a human readable string to the template.\nNo image support yet. Some shows might have disabled CORS or use a relative URL for image, which forces osmosfeed to download the image during build. A future version may support it.\nYou can't republish the podcast in the feed output.

This is not a breaking change as our compile target is still node 14, and node 16 is backward compatible. We still recommend you start using node-version: \"16\" in your .github/workflows/update-feed.yaml today to get the performance/security improvements from the newer node. See example\nChore: Reorganize to monorepo with npm workspace.",
